# GuadamelloBot
Just uploading the discord bot I made to github.

You would also need to put your own token where it says TOKEN = "" in bot.py, and you would probably want to customize your responses in responses.py
Don't use my code its probably pretty bad overall but if you do then run it with Pycharm or smth idk.
